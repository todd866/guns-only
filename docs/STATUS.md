# Current product and verification status

Updated: 2026-08-10
Production: Build 301, revision `cc1a2437a591c360da95eca87045f67b44ea3401`, deployment
`dpl_8NvBdbbXxYK3Q1ssKW5yxyDZoS17` (verified live via /api/build-info 2026-08-10). Builds
253-298 shipped without this ledger always being updated in lock-step; treat per-build claims in
that range with care.
Next candidate: Build 302 (branch `fix/cobra-play-f22`) — F-22 play chrome on cobra-lab, flight audio on, Camp Ember pad eye cleared of green mass.


This is the evergreen status page. Dated plans, browser-drive reports, and handoffs remain useful
evidence for the build and commit they name, but they do not override this page or the executable
catalog in `web/wwwroot/render/progression/campaign_progression.js`.

## Release-state meanings

- **production** — visible on the public front door and accepted for normal launch.
- **coming-soon** — visible on the public front door as a teaser; selectable for briefing, never launches.
- **preview** — intentionally retained for development; requires explicit preview acknowledgement.
- **quarantined** — has a known player-path or acceptance blocker; must fail closed before launch.
- **retired** — retained only for history or migration and must not be routed.

`hidden` HTML is never a release control. Main-shell routing and standalone sub-apps enforce these
states, while `?preview=1` provides a deliberate testing acknowledgement without promoting a route.

## Experience matrix

| Experience | State | Public surface | Current evidence | Promotion blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-22A · Guns Only (`first-merge`) | **production** | Aircraft picker | Build 238 automation plus a recorded 2026-08-02 human acceptance flight (session `web-1785627445839-631596`). Build 264 graduated the sparring pair together; Build 265 aimed Ace fire at the ballistic solution | Fresh human flight on Build 266+ to confirm Ace gunnery; w1 snapshot despawn; descent sim-step spike; lead/ballistics quality |
| Rapier · Intercept (`rapier-intercept`) | **production** | Aircraft picker | Build 238 automation earns the 24 km/M4.2 shelf, takes one physical M61 pass, then traps and stops at 2,520 s; the no-trigger mirror traps without firing and truthfully ends Draw | Fresh representative human launch/intercept/recovery flight and complete green release gate |
| Low-level drone intercept (`low-level-drone`) | **quarantined** | Preview acknowledgement only | Runtime and automated contracts exist | Ground-target/player-purpose closure and complete human flight |
| CASEVAC flight course (`medevac`) | **quarantined** | Preview acknowledgement only | Candidate guidance follows the authored orchard-gap route and briefs 32–42 m AGL near the windbreak | End-to-end human pickup, handoff, safe-exit, and debrief flight |
| Rapier circuits (`rapier-circuits`) | **preview** | Preview acknowledgement only | Circuit/recovery automation exists | Re-audit stale quarantines and record a complete representative circuit/trap |
| F9F-2 Panther off Essex (`korea-panther`) | **quarantined** | Preview acknowledgement only | Build 238 ownship-only kernel flies the production terrain catapult/route/return/groove to a physical W2 trap (100/100 focused); packaged route, touch-RTB, HUD, and barrier contracts passed silent-browser acceptance | Complete representative human desktop/touch flights and historical/presentation acceptance before any promotion |
| MIDGE-03 Facility Nine (`indoor`) | **quarantined** | `/indoor/` preview acknowledgement | Candidate UI now enforces doctrine-safe controls and blocks premature return | Re-drive the default stealth route and representative touch/keyboard paths |
| Parked Medevac command prototype (`medevac-command`, `/medevac/`) | **quarantined** | Standalone preview acknowledgement | Deterministic command/logistics prototype | It is research, not the canonical CASEVAC course; move out of production publish closure or explicitly graduate it |
| Cobra Canyon (`cobra-lab`, `/cobra-lab/`) | **production** | Standalone route | Hold the Bridge / Ember Run: AH-1G, sim-owned ground war, tip/hold win/lose, M134 + Camp Ember rearm, Tab/F gunner. Build 301: land spur Camp Ember FOB, airborne soft gates, denser Iron Bell destroyables | Owner verify land FOB + path + bridge fight; flare landing. Longer arc: DCS-BS1-grade flight dynamics |
| Weekend Ride (`weekend-ride`, `/weekend-ride/`) | **production** | Aircraft picker + standalone route | YZF-R1 dynamics/powertrain/lean/load, lappable circuit from Build 264+. Build 267 adds ride telemetry (speed/gear/lean/lap/frame) | Fresh representative human lap on the fixed artifact; deeper instrumentation still provisional |

## Research-only packages

- **Armstrong cable-strike** is not an experience state and has no catalog or browser exposure.
  Its promotion gate is deliberately `SAFE / INELIGIBLE`. It must not be described as preview,
  quarantined, or production until immutable evidence and the executable promotion gate agree.

## Release health

- Live production is Build 301 (`cc1a2437`, `dpl_8NvBdbbXxYK3Q1ssKW5yxyDZoS17`). Shipped from
  PR #44; Verify green on the merge SHA after one documented re-run of flaky
  `boot does not stutter` smoke. Do not treat that gate as a frame-rate measurement.
- A candidate is releasable only when its exact pushed SHA has a complete green gate, or the
  owner accepts a documented flaky-gate exception with live `/api/build-info` verification.
- Production deployment fails closed unless it can pin the current public rollback identity.

## Updating this page

When an experience changes state, update the executable catalog, its tests, this matrix, and the
last human acceptance evidence together. Promotion requires all four; a menu edit or a passing unit
test alone is insufficient.
